# Redis and Node.js Queuing System

This project demonstrates the integration of **Redis** with **Node.js** to implement a variety of queuing and data-handling use cases. The project includes foundational setups, publisher-subscriber mechanisms, and job queuing using Redis and the `kue` library.

## Features

1. **Redis Setup and Node.js Integration**:
   - Basic operations using Redis commands like `SET`, `GET`, and `DEL`.
   - Connection management with the Redis server.

2. **Advanced Data Handling**:
   - Storing complex data structures such as hashes.
   - Retrieval and logging of hash-based data.

3. **Publisher-Subscriber System**:
   - A simple Pub/Sub mechanism for broadcasting messages.
   - Handling real-time notifications using Redis channels.

4. **Job Queuing and Processing**:
   - Utilizing the `kue` library to create and manage jobs.
   - Processing queued jobs with custom handlers.
   - Simulating real-world use cases like SMS delivery and tracking.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Redis**: Download and install from [Redis.io](https://redis.io/).
- **Node.js**: Install the latest version from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olu433/0x03-queuing_system_in_js.git
   cd redis-queue-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Redis server:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running Redis Client
For basic Redis operations, execute:
```bash
node 0-redis_client.js
```

### Publisher-Subscriber Model
1. Start the **subscriber** in one terminal:
   ```bash
   node 5-subscriber.js
   ```
2. Publish messages using the **publisher**:
   ```bash
   node 5-publisher.js
   ```

### Job Queuing System
1. Create jobs with:
   ```bash
   node 6-job_creator.js
   ```
2. Process jobs using:
   ```bash
   node 6-job_processor.js
   ```
